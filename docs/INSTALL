This document contains instructions for installing the Agora forums
application on your system.

For information on the capabilities and features of Agora, see the file
README_ in the top-level directory of the Agora distribution.


Obtaining Agora
===============

Agora is currently only available via CVS, since it is still in early
development.  A packaged release will be made once it is ready for wider
testing.

Bleeding-edge development versions of Agora are available via CVS; see the
file `docs/HACKING`_ in the Horde distribution for information on accessing
the Horde CVS repository.


Prerequisites
=============

To function properly, Agora requires the following:

1. A working Horde installation.

   Agora runs within the `Horde Application Framework`_, a set of common tools
   for Web applications written in PHP.  You must install Horde before
   installing Agora.  If you want to use the Text_Figlet_ support, you need at
   least Horde Version 3.2.

   .. _`Horde Application Framework`: http://www.horde.org/horde/

   The Horde Framework can be obtained from the Horde website and FTP server,
   at

      http://www.horde.org/horde/

      ftp://ftp.horde.org/pub/horde/

   Many of Agora's prerequisites are also Horde prerequisites.  Be sure to
   have completed all of the steps in the INSTALL_ file for the Horde
   Framework before installing Agora.

2. A working Horde DataTree driver.

   Agora stores its data in the Horde DataTree system.  You must have a
   DataTree driver configured in Horde that supports persistant storage.

3. The following PEAR modules:
   (See `horde/docs/INSTALL`_ for instructions on installing PEAR modules)

   a. Text_Figlet [OPTIONAL]

      Text_Figlet is required if you want users to enter a verification string
      if they are submitting a new message, to determine real users from spam
      bots.  Text_Figlet requires a Figlet_ font available on your local file
      system.

      .. _Figlet: http://www.figlet.org/


Installing Agora
================

To install the Agora application, checkout agora from the Horde CVS server
into your Horde directory and would then find Agora at the URL::

   http://your-server/horde/agora/


Configuring Agora
=================

1. Configuring Horde for Agora

   a. Register the application

      In ``horde/config/registry.php``, find the ``applications['agora']``
      stanza.  The ``status`` parameter should be marked ``'=> active'``.  If
      you have changed the location of Agora relative to Horde, either in the
      URL or in the filesystem or both, you must update the ``fileroot`` and
      ``webroot`` settings to their correct values.

   b. Configuring a DataTree backend

      Agora requires a permanent ``DataTree`` backend in Horde to manage
      forums messages.  If you didn't setup a DataTree backend yet, go to the
      configuration interface, select Horde from the list of applications and
      select a driver different than ``None`` on the ``DataTree System`` tab.
      Make sure that you ran the necessary scripts to create a storage backend
      for the DataTree system, e.g. one of the ``create.*.sql`` or
      ``horde_datatree.*.sql`` SQL scripts in ``horde/scripts/sql/``.  You
      should have done this already during the installation of Horde.

2. Configuring Agora

   To configure Agora, change to the ``config/`` directory of the installed
   distribution, and make copies of all of the configuration ``dist`` files
   without the ``dist`` suffix::

      cd config/
      for foo in *.dist; do cp $foo `basename $foo .dist`; done

   Documentation on the format of those files can be found in each file.  With
   the exception of the ``conf.*`` files (see below), the other files in
   ``config/`` need only be modified if you wish to customize Agora's
   appearance or behavior, as the defaults will be correct for most sites.

   You must login to Horde as a Horde Administrator to finish the
   configuration of Agora.  Use the Horde ``Administration`` menu item to get
   to the administration page, and then click on the ``Configuration`` icon to
   get the configuration page.  Select ``Forums`` from the selection list of
   applications.  Fill in or change any configuration values as needed.  When
   done click on ``Generate Forums Configuration`` to generate the
   ``conf.php`` file.  If your web server doesn't have write permissions to
   the Agora configuration directory or file, it will not be able to write the
   file.  In this case, go back to ``Configuration`` and choose one of the
   other methods to create the configuration file ``agora/config/conf.php``.

   Note for international users: Agora uses GNU gettext to provide local
   translations of text displayed by applications; the translations are found
   in the po/ directory.  If a translation is not yet available for your
   locale (and you wish to create one), see the ``horde/po/README`` file, or
   if you're having trouble using a provided translation, please see the
   `horde/docs/TRANSLATIONS`_ file for instructions.

3. Testing Agora

   Use Agora to create forums and post in them. Test at least the following:

   - Create a new forum
   - Edit a forum
   - Post to a forum
   - Reply to a message
